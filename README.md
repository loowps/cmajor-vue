# Cmajor + Vue.js

![cmajorpatch screenshot](screenshot.png)

Proof of concept [cmajor] gain fx patch with [vuejs] gui.

To test the patch simply run `npm install` and `npm run build`. Afterward drag the .cmajorpatch from
the dist directory to the cmaj-plugin within your daw or play the patch via the cmaj command line tool.

For development use `npm run build-dev` to rebuild the patch on change.

Tested with Cmajor Version: 1.0.2358 running the cmaj-plugin in Bitwig v5.1.6 on Windows 10.

#### Known issues / future improvements

- currently running the patch via the vscode extension does not seem to work
- when loading a patch the default values don't seem to be reflected inside the host

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
