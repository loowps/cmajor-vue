# Cmajor + Vue.js

![cmajorpatch screenshot](screenshot.png)

Proof of concept [cmajor] gain fx patch with [vuejs] gui.

To test the patch simply run `npm install` and `npm run build`. Afterward drag the .cmajorpatch from
the dist directory to the cmaj-plugin within your daw or play the patch via the cmaj command line tool.

For development use `npm run build-dev` to rebuild the patch on change.

Tested with Cmajor Version: 1.0.2358 running the cmaj-plugin in Bitwig v5.1.6 on Windows 10.

#### Known issues / future improvements

- currently running the patch via the vscode extension does not seem to work
- when loading a patch the default values don't seem to be reflected inside the host
